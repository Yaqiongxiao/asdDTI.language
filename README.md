# Altered white matter connectivity and its associations with language abilities in young children with autism spectrum disorder
This manuscript is currently under review. 

DTI data were analyzed with Python Automated Fiber Quantification (pyAFQ; https://yeatmanlab.github.io/pyAFQ/; Kruper et al., 2021), an open-source tool that facilitates customized analysis. The “ParticipantAFQ” function was used to handle the entire workflow, including tractography, registration, segmentation, cleaning, profiling, and visualization. 

Tidy data and R scripts used for all the statistical analyses are available in the _data_ and _Rscripts_ folders separately.
